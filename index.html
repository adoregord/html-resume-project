    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3><b>Water Quality Classification System in Fish Aquaculture</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed and developed a comprehensive water quality classification system for categorizing water quality in fish ponds, providing farmers
            with valuable insights for their fish.</li>
        <li> Created a 3D design and schematic diagram to ensure the efficient installation and connection of all system components.</li>
        <li>Programmed an ESP-32 microcontroller using C++ and Python to perform real-time water quality classification using KNN + PCA.</li>
        <li>Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques, which allowed us to reduce storage space usage on the ESP by 50%,
            optimizing data storage and transmission efficiency.</li>
        <li>Implemented data visualization through the Blynk platform, enabling users to monitor water quality on their mobile devices or laptops.</li>  
    </ul>

    <h3><b>Indoor Air Quality Classification System</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Took the lead in a three-person team, conceptualizing and proposing the development of an indoor air quality classification system to
            address a pressing need.</li>
        <li>Spearheaded the project from ideation to execution, ensuring that team members collaborated effectively to achieve our goals.</li>
        <li>Programmed an Arduino UNO microcontroller using C++ and utilized K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm for classification, resulting
            in timely and accurate results.</li>
        <li>Achieved an 86.67% accuracy rate in assessing air quality, demonstrating the successful implementation of the project idea.</li>
        <li>The system displayed real-time air quality data on an integrated LCD screen, improving user awareness and promoting healthier indoor
            environments.</li>
    </ul>
